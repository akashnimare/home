Hey beginners,
Congrats on making your way to open source. It’s a great community.
It’s a bit confusing in the starting. How to contribute, where to contribute, issues, bugs, PR, PR, PR!
Don’t worry, as you get yourself involved in open source you’ll learn it all.
But today I’d like to give you all some advice which I never received when I started my open source journey.
I started contributing to open source and putting all my tiny side projects on GitHub a while ago. Back then I didn’t know about the README part. Time passed and I started following some kickass developers. No doubt they all had amazing projects but the one most common thing was, all their projects had awesome README and that’s how I came to know about the importance of a good README.
STOP!! I’m not interested in reading about your open source journey. Just tell me about how to write a good README.
Cool. So here you go —
Before you start putting your awesome projects on GitHub, I want you to go and read about Readme Driven Development first.
